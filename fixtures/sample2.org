* Three tiers of social power
* Twitter model
** one website, one corporation
* Fediverse model
** many websites, many communities, all talking
** mastodon
** peertube
** etc...
* User model
** there are just people connecting with other people without any inherent "community" aspect
*** the downside to this model is that in order to have community one somewhat artificially synthesize a community model since the other models come with a community aspect out of the box
*** I believe that sites like github arose out of this inherent lack of community in the user model
** git
** blockchain
